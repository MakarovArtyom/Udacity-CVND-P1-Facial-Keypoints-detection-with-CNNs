# Facial Keypoint Detection

## Project Overview

First project from Udacity Computer Vision [Nanodegree](https://www.udacity.com/course/computer-vision-nanodegree--nd891).
The goal is to build a complete pipeline for facial keypoint detection in images, combining computer vision and deep learning techniques.
The completed code performs:

 * Face detection in image sample (detector based on Haar Cascade);
 * Cropping of detected face;
 * Allocation of 68 facial keypoints, including points around eyes, nose and mouth.
